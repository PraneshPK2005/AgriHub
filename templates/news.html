              Indian farmers are pushing for the legalisation of an historic
              pricing mechanism that built India’s food security, but the
              problems they face demand far more As farmers once again protest
              in India – three years on from the biggest peaceful civil society
              protest in the world – it is worth remembering that agriculture
              was also a critical issue for the nation in its first decades. The
              country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, bluntly stated
              that “everything can wait, but not agriculture.” This line of
              thinking eventually led to the Green Revolution of the late 1960s,
              forging India’s food security and providing much-needed revenue
              for some of its farmers. But back in the present, a looming water
              crisis has returned Indian agriculture to the spotlight.

              There’s a pungent odor on Ratna Raju’s farm that he says is
              protecting his crops from the unpredictable and extreme weather
              that’s become more frequent with human-caused climate change. The
              smell comes from a concoction of cow urine, an unrefined sugar
              known as jaggery, and other organic materials that act as
              fertilizers, pesticides and bad weather barriers for his corn,
              rice, leafy greens and other vegetables on his farm in Guntur in
              India’s southern Andhra Pradesh state. The region is frequently
              hit by cyclones and extreme heat, and farmers say that so-called
              natural farming protects their crops because the soil can hold
              more water, and their more robust roots help the plants withstand
              strong winds.

              Weather and the climate are maybe the number one risk to our
              company,” says the boss of our Country flour firm Shepherd’s
              Grain. Based in Idaho, the business sources wheat from farmers
              across the US Pacific northwest. As weather patterns become more
              unpredictable, Mr Bunch says: “I need to have a plan B, and plan
              C, in case plan A fails.” To help strengthen these plans, Mr
              Bunch’s company is now using an AI-powered software system called
              ClimateAi. Using current and past data, such as from satellite
              imagery and temperature and rainfall readings, and combining that
              with future projections, ClimateAi aims to give farmers the most
              accurate possible, locally-tailored weather forecasts, from one
              hour to six months ahead. It then advises on exactly when to plant
              and harvest particular crops, and predicts their yields.
              Shepherd’s Grain only started using ClimateAi last year, but
              already most of its 40 plus farmers are now being guided by the
              app. “They’re beginning to look at ClimateAi to help them plan for
              crop management decisions in their wheat crops, the primary crop
              grown in the region,” says Mr Bunch. “A forward look at the
              weather helps our growers decide which crops to plant. The
              platform knows when to plant, and when the crop will start
              flowering and producing seed.” One of the biggest problems facing
              the seed industry is how to launch climate resilient seeds to
              market faster and cheaper, says Himanshu Gupta, chief executive of
              San Francisco-based ClimateAi. “By the time some seed companies do
              this, in say 10 to 15 years, the climate has already changed,”
              says Mr Gupta. “We are running against time to launch new seed
              varieties.” He says that ClimateAi helps these firms to see how
              specific test seeds have performed in a particular region or
              locality. “This can help seed companies figure out the optimal
              locations for growing seeds.”

              According to the report, the government made no progress on
              several manifesto points regarding farmers’ welfare. These include
              a promise to offer short-term new agricultural loans (Kisan Credit
              Card or KCC loans) up to Rs 1 lakh at a 0% interest rate for one
              to five years. While the announcement of such a scheme was
              anticipated before the union budget presentation in 2019, and
              though fact-checkers found fake newspaper articles claiming that
              such a scheme was set to be launched, the Kisan Credit Card
              scheme, launched in the late 1990s, has had interest subventions,
              very low interest rates, and a rise in outstanding loans extended
              by banks through the KCC, but no loans at a 0% interest rate.

              Curbs on rice, wheat, sugar and onion shipments have taken a toll
              on India’s farm exports in the fiscal ended, after a
              record-breaking performance in 2022-23 India’s agricultural
              exports fell 8.2% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 on the
              back of shipment curbs on a host of commodities, from cereals and
              sugar to onions. The value of farm exports totaled $48.82 billion
              in 2023-24, down from the record $53.15 billion of 2022-23 and
              $50.24 billion for the previous fiscal, according to Department of
              Commerce data. Exports declined during the initial years of the
              Narendra Modi government (from $43.25 billion in 2013-14 to $35.60
              billion in 2019-20), while accompanied by an increase in imports
              (from $15.53 billion to $21.86 billion).
